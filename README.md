### Web application that chiefly revolves around the flashcards
*If you are a person who loves to learn foreign languages, I would risk and say that
you've been using flashcards for education purposes. So have I. This web app is probably
a typical flashcard's system broadly available on internet in a different forms.
Nevertheless, I've built this app, because flashcards really did help me with grasping new 
foreign languages phrases/words, and I thought It's high time I did conduct a thorough
revision of a spring framework.*
